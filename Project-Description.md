### Project Sought
I would ideally like to work on a project relating to Computer Graphics.  This kind of project would involve the application of complex algorithms to create a visual output.  One potential project along these lines would be creating a raytracer.  This program simulates the movement of light as it is put out by a source and bounces around the environment before finally colliding with a virtual camera.  In this case, the main algorithms involved in this project would be based around real-world physics.
