## Project Abstract
Our VR-based project is a user-friendly 3D modelling sandbox that simplifies the intricate controls of traditional desktop 3D modeling software, enabling anyone to create personalized 3D objects. With the added advantage of viewing models in VR, game developers can better gauge the scale and dimension of objects intended for VR environments. This versatile tool caters to both novice learners and casual users, offering an immersive and exclusive experience
