# Project Description

## Abstract
Our VR-based project is a user-friendly 3D modeling sandbox that simplifies the intricate controls of traditional desktop 3D modeling software, enabling anyone to create personalized 3D objects. With the added advantage of viewing models in VR, game developers can better gauge the scale and dimension of objects intended for VR environments. This versatile tool caters to both novice learners and casual users, offering an immersive and exclusive experience.

## Goals
- To give users an intuitive way to create and edit simple 3D models in VR.

- Reduce high learning curve of 3D modeling through VR

- Will be intuitive for beginners, and allow experts to create something special.

- Replicate tools of 3D modeling software in VR
