This work was done during the last two weeks of the project alone.  These meetings involved the group meeting to work on development in one location.  Evidence of these meetings can be found in the commit history of our [project on github](https://github.com/AdoniaJ1/VisualReality/graphs/commit-activity) the [account used on the PC we were using for development](https://github.com/bowlinnr).
