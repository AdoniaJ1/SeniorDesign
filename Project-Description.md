### Project Sought
I would ideally like to work on a project relating to Computer Graphics.  This kind of project would involve the application of complex algorithms to create a visual output.  One potential project along these lines would be creating a raytracer.  This program simulates the movement of light as it is put out by a source and bounces around the environment before finally colliding with a virtual camera.  In this case, the main algorithms involved in this project would be based around real-world physics.

### Co-op Work Experience:

I have spent 3 rotations with Fox Sports: Spring 2021, Fall 2021, and Summer 2022.  
I spent 2 rotations on the QA team writing automated tests and doing tech debt related tasks.  
The last rotation, I was a QA member on the front-end, "FSCOM" team. 
 On this team, I tested tickets and bugs for each release, and talked with developers to go over any problems.

### Project Sought

I am very familiar with Java, C, C++, Python, JavaScript(Postman), and I have worked with an Arduino before.  
Although, I would be willing to learn any new languages or skills in order to make any project work.  
However, If a project were to have more of a hardware focus, I would hope I could play a large part in the necessary software.
